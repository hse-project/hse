"""
This test checks basic ingest and get operation in LC.
It creates 2 active transactions, inserts keys in them and calls sync (ingest)
It then checks whether a point get reads the correct uncommitted kv-tuples from LC.
It also checks if the right values are read if a txn is committed or aborted.

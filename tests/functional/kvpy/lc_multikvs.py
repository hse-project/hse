This test inserts keys in 2 KVSes and makes sure that a cursor over one kvs returns keys only
from that kvs. This test is focussed mainly on LC.

To add keys to LC and make sure that an unintended ingest doesn't move it all to cn set these
two run time params:
    1. durability.enabled = false // kvdb_sync() ingests to lc + cn
    2. c0_debug = 16              // ingest only when sync is called. See C0_DEBUG_ACCUMULATE in hse.

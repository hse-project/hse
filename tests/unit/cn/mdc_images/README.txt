These images are used by various tests.

The .cndblog files are consumed by cndb_log_test.c

Both sets can be generated by typing "make." Your path must point to
cndb_log, mdc_tool, hse and cndb_txn_inject.

The .log6 files are images in the deprecated cn_log OMF used by cursor
tests.  There is no way to create a cn_log MDC, and thus no way to
regenerate these files.

NOTE:  the kvs drop tests require the following procedure whenever simpledrop_cndblog.txt and simpledrop_recovery_cndblog.txt change:
1) Invoke make in this directory
2) Invoke the top-level make to re-generate the inject programs
3) Invoke make in this directory

Refinements obviating this are left as exercises for the reader.

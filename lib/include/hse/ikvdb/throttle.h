/**
 * struct throttle_sensor - throttle sensor
 *
 * Modules that provide throttler input (e.g., c0 and cn) should
 * periodically update their respective sensors to indicate their workload.
 * Sensors should be set to a value between 0 and 2 * THROTTLE_SENSOR_SCALE.
 *
 * Guidelines for setting sensor values:
 *
 *  - The value should reflect the current workload and should not include
 *    hysteresis (hysteresis is implemented in the throttler code that reads
 *    sensors).
 *
 *  - A value of 0 indicates a workload below a low water mark.
 *
 *  - Values between 0 and THROTTLE_SENSOR_SCALE indicate a workload between
 *    low and high water marks.
 *
 *  - Values between THROTTLE_SENSOR_SCALE and 2*THROTTLE_SENSOR_SCALE
 *    indicate a workload between a high water mark and ceiling.
 *
 *  - The value should be a linear indication of workload, for example, a
 *    value of THROTTLE_SENSOR_SCALE / 10 should indicate a workload 10% into
 *    the range between the low and high water marks.
 *
 * For example, suppose c0's workload is determined by the amount of memory
 * (M) consumed by c0 kvms that have not yet been ingested to cN, and that c0
 * is configured with three thresholds for memory consumption: LOW, HIGH, and
 * MAX.  Then c0 might set the sensor value as follows:
 *
 *    if (M < LOW)
 *        sensor = 0;
 *
 *    if (LOW <= M < HIGH)
 *        sensor = THROTTLE_SENSOR_SCALE * (M - LOW) / (HIGH - LOW);
 *
 *    if (HIGH <= M < MAX)
 *        sensor = THROTTLE_SENSOR_SCALE * (M - HIGH) / (MAX - HIGH);
 *
 * Note, this throttling approach is based on c0sk throttling behavior prior
 * implementation of 'struct throttle'.

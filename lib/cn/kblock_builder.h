 *
 * 2. Repeatedly invoke kbb_add_entry() and/or kbb_is_empty() as needed.  The
 *    kblock builder object will allocate and write kblocks as needed.

 * 3. To abort, call kbb_destroy() at any time.  This will free all internal
 *    resources and abort any kblocks allocated during calls to
 *    kbb_add_entry().

 * 4. To finish, call kbb_finish(), which will allocate and write the final
 *    kblock and return a list of IDs for all kblocks that have been allocated
 *    and written but not committed since the kblock builder was created with
 *    kbb_create().
 *
 * 5. It is up to the caller to abort or commit the kblocks whose IDs are
 *    returned by kbb_finish().
